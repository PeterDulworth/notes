# Stat 310 Final

$H_0$ Null hypothesis: thing you are testing has no effect

$H_1$ Alternative hypothesis: what you are testing



so,

assume null hypothesis is true

then what is the probability that you got the new results? if that probability is rally rally small, then the Null hypothesis is probably false



i.e.





**type i error** incorrectly accept alternative hypothesis (*false positive*)

**type ii error** incorrectly reject the alternative hypothesis  (*false negative*)



The region where we decide to reject $H_0$ is called the critical region. It is a subset of $\R ^n$ where $n$ is the number of samples.
