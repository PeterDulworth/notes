$H_0$ Null hypothesis: thing you are testing has no effect

$H_1$ Alternative hypothesis: what you are testing



so,

assume null hypothesis is true

then what is the probability that you got the new results? if that probability is rally rally small, then the Null hypothesis is probably false



i.e.



**Simple Hypothesis** All the parameters are specified (e.g. mean, variance).

**Composite Hypothesis** Not all the parameters are specified.



**Type i error** incorrectly accept alternative hypothesis (*false positive*).

**Type ii error** incorrectly reject the alternative hypothesis  (*false negative*).



The probability of a type I error is called the **significance level** of the test. The complement of the type I error probability is called the **confidence level** of the test.



The region where we decide to reject $H_0$ is called the critical region. It is a subset of $\R ^n$ where $n$ is the number of samples.



1. Guassian shift with common variance (assume $\sigma ^ 2 $ is known).
2. Guassian shift with common *but unknown* variance: *t-test*.





One sample $t$ test. (variance same but unknown)

Paired $t$-test: data in form $(X_i, Y_i)$. ~ *7.18* ($\sigma ^2$ unknown)

Two sample $t$-test.  (unknown but common variance)



**What if parameters are unknown?**

Modify the log-likelihood so that the unknonw parameters are replaced by MLE's (constrained).
