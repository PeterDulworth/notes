# COMP 322 HW 4 REPORT

**Design Description**

In order to maximize parallelism, I created $n$ threads, where $n$ is the number of threads passed into the $runIteration$ function. Each thread runs the sequential algorithm with slight modification outlined below:

I changed the $nodesLoaded$ list to be a concurrent queue so that multiple threads can operate on it safely. In order to keep the threads from coliding, I added a lock field to the ParComponent class so that each node would have its own lock. This allowed me to share the work of the while loop but at the same time ensure that all parallel work is always happening on disjoint $(n, other)$ pairs.

My implementation is data-race free and can't result in live-lock or dead-lock because before operating on any node, I always check that nodes lock, to make sure that no other thread is operating on that node.
