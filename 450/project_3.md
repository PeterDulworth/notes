# C450 Project 3 Deliverables

- (5 points) A succinct statement of the problem that you solved. 

- (5 points) A short description of the robots (their geometry) and configuration spaces you tested in 

  exercise 2. 

- (5 points) Images of your environments and a description of the start-goal queries you tested in 

  exercise 2. 

- (5 points) Summarize your experience in implementing the planner and testing in exercise 2. How 

  would you characterize the performance of your planner in these instances? What do the solution paths 

  look like? 

- (15 points) Compare and contrast the solutions of your RTP with the PRM, EST, and RRT planners from 

  exercise 3. Elaborate on the performance of your RTP. Conclusions must be presented quantitatively from the benchmark data. Consider the following metrics: computation time, path length, and the number of states sampled (graph states). 

- (5 points) Rate the difficulty of each exercise on a scale of 1â€“10 (1 being trivial, 10 being impossible). Give an estimate of how many hours you spent on each exercise, and detail what was the hardest part of the assignment.
