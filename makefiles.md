# MakeFiles

Format:

```makefile
target: dependencies
	action
```

Note: makefiles are whitespace sensitive so `target` must be all the way to the left and there must be exactly one tab before `action`.

- A *target* is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as ‘clean’.
- A *prerequisite* is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files.
- A *recipe* is an action that `make` carries out. A recipe may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line. **Please note:** you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line! This is an obscurity that catches the unwary. If you prefer to prefix your recipes with a character other than tab, you can set the `.RECIPEPREFIX` variable to an alternate character.

Example:

```makefile
edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
       insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c
command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c command.c
display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c display.c
insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c insert.c
search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c search.c
files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h
        cc -c files.c
utils.o : utils.c defs.h
        cc -c utils.c
clean :
        rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
           insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
```

By default, `make` starts with the first target (not targets whose names start with ‘.’). This is called the *default goal*. In the simple example of the previous section, the default goal is to update the executable program edit; therefore, we put that rule first.
